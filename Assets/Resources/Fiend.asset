  civEffectText: Your turn is over. Place this card in front of you so all CIVILIANS
    can identify the FIEND. Discard your BUNKER to the SCRAPYARD and then shuffle
    the SCRAPYARD back into the deck. Be sure to follow the FIEND descriptions on
    all cards. Starting on your second turn as a FIEND, you can give this card to
    any CIVILIAN that does not have any STRUCTURES. They become the new FIEND and
    you can build your BUNKER again.
  civFlavorText: You are now the FIEND.
  fiendEffectText: You may give this card to any CIVILIAN you choose. They are now
    the new FIEND.
  fiendFlavorText: You are now a CIVILIAN.
